# Project Background

The Kediri Government has several issues, such as the low quality of OPD planning documents and the lack of effectiveness in systematically arranged education data. In addition, there is a lack of human resources (HR) who have the skills and competencies suitable for their tasks and responsibilities. The goal of this project is to analyze and design an education quality dashboard in order to optimize education planning and distribution, evaluate the performance of the Education Office based on the classification of key performance indicator achievements, and map schools based on their quality in Kediri.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- Information on Educational Human Resources in Kediri City: Shows data on 216 schools, 3,875 teachers, 66K students, a teacher–student ratio of 68.28, and ratio trends from 2020–2023 across education levels.
- Shows OPD goal achievements (2014–2022), target vs realization (2018–2022), qualified teacher growth, 61.67% achieved indicators, and KPI clusters such as schooling years, graduation, and enrollment rates.
- Shows student distribution by level (public/private), facility availability (classrooms, labs, libraries), school accreditation (A 46.76%, B 46.76%, Not Accredited 8.7%), and a school quality clustering map across Kediri.

# Data Structure & Initial Checks
The data were collected from various sources, including the official website of Kediri City and the Kediri City Strategic Plan (Renstra).
